# Updates

Found the source for the spikes and fixed it: `.generate()` is the wrong method, need `.forward()` $\to$ wrong conditionals! Now maximizes the likelihood and faster!

- New generated slogans seem better, space looks more interesting (have yet to do the "box" normalization)
- Maybe even further performance gains by using `past_key_values`

- Idea: LLM judge to assess grammar / quality of slogans?
- (MLFlow)
