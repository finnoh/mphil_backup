# Updates

Improved the optimization: `.generate()` is the wrong method, need `.forward()` $\to$ wrong conditionals! Now maximizes the likelihood and is faster!

- Space looks different now; Does maximizing the likelihood collapse the encoding space?
- Maybe even further performance gains by using `past_key_values`?

- Idea: LLM judge to assess grammar / quality of slogans?
- (MLFlow)

MPhil: Need to start working towards the paper now
