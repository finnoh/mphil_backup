  abstract = {Although a considerable amount of research in personality psychology has been done to conceptualize human personality, identify the ``Big Five'' dimensions, and explore the meaning of each dimension, no parallel research has been conducted in consumer behavior on brand personality. Consequently, an understanding of the symbolic use of brands has been limited in the consumer behavior literature. In this research, the author develops a theoretical framework of the brand personality construct by determining the number and nature of dimensions of brand personality (Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, and Ruggedness). To measure the five brand personality dimensions, a reliable, valid, and generalizable measurement scale is created. Finally, theoretical and practical implications regarding the symbolic use of brands are discussed.},

  abstract = {Price frictions reduce the success of new products and impact retailers' product assortments.           ,              The literature has documented that price frictions limit the frequency of price changes. We show that they are also associated with the failure of new products. Using the IRI academic data set, we identify new products that have low initial sales. When price frictions are high, retailers are less likely to adjust the price, and instead are more likely to discontinue the new product. We replicate the results by investigating retailer price and product line adjustments following the opening of a new store. We investigate three settings in which retailers may be reluctant to adjust prices on a new product: (a) when there are no price changes on related products, (b) when state-level pricing laws require price stickers on each package, and (c) when the initial prices end in 99¢. The sources of variation are very different across these settings, ranging from the timing of wholesale price changes to variation in state consumer protection laws to kinks in the demand curve associated with 99¢ price endings. Despite this diversity, our findings are consistent, suggesting that larger price frictions coincide with a higher probability that new items are discontinued when initial sales are low. This consistency leads us to conclude that it is more plausible that the effect is causal, rather than an artifact of endogeneity.

  abstract = {Companies in a variety of sectors are increasingly managing customer churn proactively, generally by detecting customers at the highest risk of churning and targeting retention efforts towards them. While there is a vast literature on developing churn prediction models that identify customers at the highest risk of churning, no research has investigated whether it is indeed optimal to target those individuals. Combining two field experiments with machine learning techniques, the author demonstrates that customers identified as having the highest risk of churning are not necessarily the best targets for proactive churn programs. This finding is not only contrary to common wisdom but also suggests that retention programs are sometimes futile not because firms offer the wrong incentives but because they do not apply the right targeting rules. Accordingly, firms should focus their modeling efforts on identifying the observed heterogeneity in response to the intervention and to target customers on the basis of their sensitivity to the intervention, regardless of their risk of churning. This approach is empirically demonstrated to be significantly more effective than the standard practice of targeting customers with the highest risk of churning. More broadly, the author encourages firms and researchers using randomized trials (or A/B tests) to look beyond the average effect of interventions and leverage the observed heterogeneity in customers' response to select customer targets.},

This paper considers an ensemble approach, and shows that it performs better than any of the individual methods in several economic datasets. Matrix completion methods are often given the most weight by the ensemble, but this clearly depends on the setting. We argue that ensemble methods present a fruitful direction for further research in the causal panel data setting.},

We show that under this assumption, the correct causal structural choices lead to faster adaptation to modified distributions because the changes are concentrated in one or just a few mechanisms when the learned knowledge is modularized appropriately. This leads to sparse expected gradients and a lower effective number of degrees of freedom needing to be relearned while adapting to the change. It motivates using the speed of adaptation to a modified distribution as a meta-learning objective. We demonstrate how this can be used to determine the cause-effect relationship between two observed variables. The distributional changes do not need to correspond to standard interventions (clamping a variable), and the learner has no direct knowledge of these interventions. We show that causal structures can be parameterized via continuous variables and learned end-to-end. We then explore how these ideas could be used to also learn an encoder that would map low-level observed variables to unobserved causal variables leading to faster adaptation out-of-distribution, learning a representation space where one can satisfy the assumptions of independent mechanisms and of small and sparse changes in these mechanisms due to actions and non-stationarities.},

The authors discuss how text reflects qualities of the text producer (and the context in which the text was produced) and impacts the audience or text recipient. Next, they discuss how text can be a powerful tool both for prediction and for understanding (i.e., insights). Then, the authors overview methodologies and metrics used in text analysis, providing a set of guidelines and procedures. Finally, they further highlight some common metrics and challenges and discuss how researchers can address issues of internal and external validity. They conclude with a discussion of potential areas for future work. Along the way, the authors note how textual analysis can unite the tribes of marketing. While most marketing problems are interdisciplinary, the field is often fragmented. By involving skills and ideas from each of the subareas of marketing, text analysis has the potential to help unite the field with a common set of tools and approaches.},

However, the generation of synthetic samples with the original data's characteristics remains a significant challenge for tabular data. While many generative models from the computer vision domain, such as variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks, have been adapted for tabular data generation, less research has been directed towards recent transformer-based large language models (LLMs), which are also generative in nature. To this end, we propose GReaT (Generation of Realistic Tabular data), which exploits an auto-regressive generative LLM to sample synthetic and yet highly realistic tabular data. Furthermore, GReaT can model tabular data distributions by conditioning on any subset of features; the remaining features are sampled without additional overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a series of experiments that quantify the validity and quality of the produced data samples from multiple angles. We find that GReaT maintains state-of-the-art performance across numerous real-world and synthetic data sets with heterogeneous feature types coming in various sizes.},

  abstract = {Efforts across diverse domains like economics, energy, and agronomy have focused on developing predictive models for time series data. A spectrum of techniques, spanning from elementary linear models to intricate neural networks and machine learning algorithms, has been explored to achieve accurate forecasts. The hybrid ARIMA-SVR model has garnered attention due to its fusion of a foundational linear model with error correction capabilities. However, its use is limited to stationary time series data, posing a significant challenge. To overcome these limitations and drive progress, we propose the innovative NAR--SVR hybrid method. Unlike its predecessor, this approach breaks free from stationarity and linearity constraints, leading to improved model performance solely through historical data exploitation. This advancement significantly reduces the time and computational resources needed for precise predictions, a critical factor in univariate economic time series forecasting. We apply the NAR--SVR hybrid model in three scenarios: Spanish berry daily yield data from 2018 to 2021, daily COVID-19 cases in three countries during 2020, and the daily Bitcoin price time series from 2015 to 2020. Through extensive comparative analyses with other time series prediction models, our results substantiate that our novel approach consistently outperforms its counterparts. By transcending stationarity and linearity limitations, our hybrid methodology establishes a new paradigm for univariate time series forecasting, revolutionizing the field and enhancing predictive capabilities across various domains as highlighted in this study.},

  abstract = {I measure the spillover effect of intercollegiate athletics on the quantity and quality of applicants to institutions of higher education in the United States---an effect popularly known as the ``Flutie effect.'' I treat athletic success as a stock of goodwill that decays over time, similar to that of advertising. A major challenge is that privacy laws prevent us from observing information about the applicant pool. I overcome this challenge by using order statistic distribution to infer applicant quality from information on enrolled students. Using a flexible random-coefficients aggregate discrete choice model that accommodates heterogeneity in preferences for school quality and athletic success, as well as an extensive set of school fixed effects to control for unobserved quality in athletics and academics, I estimate the impact of athletic success on applicant quality and quantity. Overall, athletic success has a significant, long-term goodwill effect on future applications and quality. However, students with lower-than-average SAT scores tend to have a stronger preference for athletic success, whereas students with higher SAT scores have a greater preference for academic quality. Furthermore, the decay rate of athletics' goodwill is significant only for students with lower SAT scores, suggesting that the goodwill created by intercollegiate athletics resides more extensively with lower-scoring students than with their higher-scoring counterparts. But, surprisingly, athletic success impacts applications even among academically stronger students.},

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

While much of the literature focuses on capturing static cross-sectional heterogeneity, little research has been done on modeling dynamic heterogeneity, or the heterogeneous evolution of individual-level model parameters. In this work, the authors propose a novel framework for capturing the dynamics of heterogeneity, using individual-level, latent, Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes. Similar to standard heterogeneity specifications, this Gaussian process dynamic heterogeneity (GPDH) specification models individual-level parameters as flexible variations around population-level trends, allowing for sharing of statistical information both across individuals and within individuals over time. This hierarchical structure provides precise individual-level insights regarding parameter dynamics. The authors show that GPDH nests existing heterogeneity specifications and that not flexibly capturing individual-level dynamics may result in biased parameter estimates. Substantively, they apply GPDH to understand preference dynamics and to model the evolution of online reviews. Across both applications, they find robust evidence of dynamic heterogeneity and illustrate GPDH's rich managerial insights, with implications for targeting, pricing, and market structure analysis.},

In this work, we define a framework using a text compression technique on the sequences of credit card purchases to detect ubiquitous patterns of collective behavior. Clustering the consumers by their similarity in purchase sequences, we detect five consumer groups. Remarkably, post checking, individuals in each group are also similar in their age, total expenditure, gender, and the diversity of their social and mobility networks extracted from their mobile phone records. By properly deconstructing transaction data with Zipf-like distributions, this method uncovers sets of significant sequences that reveal insights on collective human behavior.},

To address this, inspired by recent successes in natural language processing, we propose a neural model for training stock embeddings, which harnesses the dynamics of historical returns data in order to learn the nuanced relationships that exist between financial assets. We describe our approach in detail and discuss a number of ways that it can be used in the financial domain.

The consumer's utility is additive in the different categories. Her preferences about product attributes as well as her price sensitivity vary across products and are in general correlated across products. We build on techniques from the machine learning literature on probabilistic models of matrix factorization, extending the methods to account for time-varying product attributes and products going out of stock. We evaluate the performance of the model using held-out data from weeks with price changes or out of stock products. We show that our model improves over traditional modeling approaches that consider each category in isolation. One source of the improvement is the ability of the model to accurately estimate heterogeneity in preferences (by pooling information across categories); another source of improvement is its ability to estimate the preferences of consumers who have rarely or never made a purchase in a given category in the training data. Using held-out data, we show that our model can accurately distinguish which consumers are most price sensitive to a given product. We consider counterfactuals such as personally targeted price discounts, showing that using a richer model such as the one we propose substantially increases the benefits of personalization in discounts.},

However, little is known about the interplay between members' purchase and redemption behavior when members are not pressured with point expiration and they choose for themselves when and how much to redeem. In this context, the effects of redemption are not straightforward, as little additional effort is required from an LP member to obtain the reward. Analyzing the behavior of 3094 members in such an LP, we find that the mere decision to redeem a reward significantly enhances purchase behavior before and after the redemption event, even when members redeem just a fraction of their accumulated points. Conceptually, we refer to this enhancement as the redemption momentum, which is an alternative and novel explanation of the existence of pre-reward effects that do not depend on points-pressure. In addition to the overall impact of redemption on purchases, prior purchase behavior also enhances redemption decisions. Finally, we find a number of moderating effects on purchase and redemption behavior that derive from the length of LP membership, age, income and direct mailings. Our study's most important managerial implication is that firms should avoid imposing point expiry and/or binding thresholds in order to enhance members' purchase behavior.},

Second, as digitalization becomes ever more important, we distinguish between skill bundles that contain two different types of IT skills, generic or expert IT skills. We expect that after involuntary separations, these different types of IT skills can have opposing effects, either reducing or amplifying earnings losses of workers with specific skill bundles. We find clearly opposing results for workers in specific occupations---but not in general occupations: Having more generic IT skills is positively correlated with earnings after involuntary separations, whereas more expert IT skills is negatively correlated.},

  abstract = {Sequential Recommendation (SR) models user dynamics and predicts the next preferred items based on the user history. Existing SR methods model the 'was interacted before' item-item transitions observed in sequences, which can be viewed as an item relationship. However, there are multiple auxiliary item relationships, e.g., items from similar brands and with similar contents in real-world scenarios. Auxiliary item relationships describe item-item affinities in multiple different semantics and alleviate the long-lasting cold start problem in the recommendation. However, it remains a significant challenge to model auxiliary item relationships in SR. To simultaneously model high-order item-item transitions in sequences and auxiliary item relationships, we propose a Multi-relational Transformer capable of modeling auxiliary item relationships for SR (MT4SR). Specifically, we propose a novel self-attention module, which incorporates arbitrary item relationships and weights item relationships accordingly. Second, we regularize intra-sequence item relationships with a novel regularization module to supervise attentions computations. Third, for inter-sequence item relationship pairs, we introduce a novel inter-sequence related items modeling module. Finally, we conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of MT4SR over state-of-the-art methods and the improvements on the cold start problem.

This method is well-suited to retailers because it relies on data that are readily available from their checkout systems and facilitates their analyses of cross-category product complementarity, in addition to within-category substitution. The approach has high usability because it is automated, is scalable and does not require a priori assumptions. Its results are easy to interpret and update as new market basket data are collected. The authors validate their approach both by conducting an extensive simulation study and by comparing their results with those of state-of-the-art, econometric methods for modeling product relationships.

  abstract = {Personalized marketing in retail requires a model to predict how different marketing actions affect product choices by individual customers. Large retailers often handle millions of transactions daily, involving thousands of products in hundreds of categories. Product choice models thus need to scale to large product assortments and customer bases, without extensive product attribute information. To address these challenges, we propose a custom deep neural network model. The model incorporates bottleneck layers to encode cross-product relationships, calibrates time-series filters to capture purchase dynamics for products with different interpurchase times, and relies on weight sharing between the products to improve convergence and scale to large assortments. The model applies to loyalty card transaction data without predefined categories or product attributes to predict customer-specific purchase probabilities in response to marketing actions. In a simulation, the proposed product choice model predicts purchase decisions better than baseline methods by adjusting the predicted probabilities for the effects of recent purchases and price discounts. The improved predictions lead to substantially higher revenue gains in a simulated coupon personalization problem. We verify predictive performance using transaction data from a large retailer with experimental variation in price discounts.

  abstract = {"Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and video games. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

In practice, customer purchase history data is readily available to make such predictions, sometimes complemented with customer characteristics. Given the large product assortments maintained by online retailers, scalability of the prediction method is just as important as its accuracy. We study two classes of models that use such data to predict what a customer will buy next, i.e., a novel approach that uses latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and mixtures of Dirichlet-Multinomials (MDM). A key benefit of a model-based approach is the potential to accommodate observed customer heterogeneity through the inclusion of predictor variables. We show that LDA can be extended in this direction while retaining its scalability. We apply the models to purchase data from an online retailer and contrast their predictive performance with that of a collaborative filter and a discrete choice model. Both LDA and MDM outperform the other methods. Moreover, LDA attains performance similar to that of MDM while being far more scalable, rendering it a promising approach to purchase prediction in large product assortments.

Combined, these products make a sizable contribution to the total purchase volume. A retailer that better understands the purchase behavior in its long tail can increase the value of these products. Yet, analyzing tail purchases at the customer level is challenging: The available purchases per product in the tail are limited, while the number of customers and products are large. We develop new methodology that overcomes these challenges and sheds light on customer-specific purchase behavior for the long tail. The idea underlying our approach is a dimension reduction that uses latent product groups to summarize tail purchase behavior. We rely on variational inference to apply our method to a large-scale purchase history dataset with almost 50,000 products and over 3 million shopping trips. We are able to identify the customers that are likely to purchase in the tail of the assortment, how this varies across product categories, and how tail purchases relate to purchases of other products in the assortment. These insights can be used to improve recommendations of tail products, facilitate navigation through the assortment, and inform assortment management decisions.},

  abstract = {In modern retail contexts, retailers sell products from vast product assortments to a large and heterogeneous customer base. Understanding purchase behavior in such a context is very important. Standard models cannot be used because of the high dimensionality of the data. We propose a new model that creates an efficient dimension reduction through the idea of purchase motivations. We only require customer-level purchase history data, which is ubiquitous in modern retailing. The model handles large-scale data and even works in settings with shopping trips consisting of few purchases. Essential features of our model are that it accounts for the product, customer, and time dimensions present in purchase history data; relates the relevance of motivations to customer- and shopping-trip characteristics; captures interdependencies between motivations; and achieves superior predictive performance. Estimation results from this comprehensive model provide deep insights into purchase behavior. Such insights can be used by managers to create more intuitive, better informed, and more effective marketing actions. As scalability of the model is essential for practical applicability, we develop a fast, custom-made inference algorithm based on variational inference. We illustrate the model using purchase history data from a Fortune 500 retailer involving more than 4,000 unique products.},

While the field of CausalNLP has attracted much interest in the recent years, existing causal inference datasets in NLP primarily rely on discovering causality from empirical knowledge (e.g., commonsense knowledge). In this work, we propose the first benchmark dataset to test the pure causal inference skills of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we formulate a novel task Corr2Cause, which takes a set of correlational statements and determines the causal relationship between the variables. We curate a large-scale dataset of more than 400K samples, on which we evaluate seventeen existing LLMs. Through our experiments, we identify a key shortcoming of LLMs in terms of their causal inference skills, and show that these models achieve almost close to random performance on the task. This shortcoming is somewhat mitigated when we try to re-purpose LLMs for this skill via finetuning, but we find that these models still fail to generalize -- they can only perform causal inference in in-distribution settings when variable names and textual expressions used in the queries are similar to those in the training set, but fail in out-of-distribution settings generated by perturbing these queries. Corr2Cause is a challenging task for LLMs, and would be helpful in guiding future research on improving LLMs' pure reasoning skills and generalizability.

We propose three mechanisms as major drivers of the crowdfunding dynamics: forward-looking delaying investment behavior, contemporaneous social interactions, and forward-looking social interactions. We apply the rational expectations equilibrium of the approximate aggregation approach to model the underlying mechanisms. Using the Bayesian IJC method, we analyze individual-level investment data from a crowdfunding platform, Sellaband. We find strong evidence for the three mechanisms and confirm that they contribute to the contrasting dynamic patterns observed in our data. We also simulate counterfactuals to derive optimal policy decisions for both fundraisers and platforms. For fundraisers, we infer the optimal goals that ensure goal completion while raising the maximum capital. For platforms, we suggest an optimal targeting strategy that identifies those crowdfunders who contribute the most to the crowding process and, ultimately, goal success. Also, we provide critical input for various resource allocation decisions by accurately predicting whether the project will succeed and when it will succeed at the time when 50\% of the goal has been achieved.},

We first solve for the case in which the manufacturer can overtly discriminate between its retailers by offering each a different two-part tariff contract. We then compare it to the case in which overt discrimination is not feasible and the manufacturer must instead induce self-selection. We find that whereas there is no role for slotting fees when overt discrimination is possible, slotting fees can arise as part of the equilibrium menu of contracts offered to both retailers in the absence of such discrimination. It is found that the large retailer always prefers the contract with the lower wholesale price, even if it means not accepting a slotting fee, whereas the small retailer always accepts the largest slotting fee offered, even though it means taking on the contract with the higher wholesale price. Our results also suggest that the wholesale prices (and hence retail prices) of both retailers will be uniformly higher when overt discrimination is infeasible.

  abstract = {With the outbreak of today's streaming data, the sequential recommendation is a promising solution to achieve time-aware personalized modeling. It aims to infer the next interacted item of a given user based on the history item sequence. Some recent works tend to improve the sequential recommendation via random masking on the history item so as to generate self-supervised signals. But such approaches will indeed result in sparser item sequence and unreliable signals. Besides, the existing sequential recommendation models are only user-centric, i.e., based on the historical items by chronological order to predict the probability of candidate items, which ignores whether the items from a provider can be successfully recommended. Such user-centric recommendation will make it impossible for the provider to expose their new items and result in popular bias. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual Contrastive Network (DCN) to generate ground-truth self-supervised signals for sequential recommendation by auxiliary user-sequence from an item-centric perspective. Specifically, we propose dual representation contrastive learning to refine the representation learning by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the representations of a given user/item and history items/users of them. Before the second contrastive learning module, we perform the next user prediction to capture the trends of items preferred by certain types of users and provide personalized exploration opportunities for item providers. Finally, we further propose dual interest contrastive learning to self-supervise the dynamic interest from the next item/user prediction and static interest of matching probability. Experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. Further ablation study also illustrates the boosting effect of the proposed components upon different sequential models.},

  abstract = {Session-based Recommendation (SBR) is to predict users' next interested items based on their previous browsing sessions. Existing methods model sessions as graphs or sequences to estimate user interests based on their interacted items to make recommendations. In recent years, graph-based methods have achieved outstanding performance on SBR. However, none of these methods consider temporal information, which is a crucial feature in SBR as it indicates timeliness or currency. Besides, the session graphs exhibit a hierarchical structure and are demonstrated to be suitable in hyperbolic geometry. But few papers design the models in hyperbolic spaces and this direction is still under exploration. In this paper, we propose Time-aware Hyperbolic Graph Attention Network (TA-HGAT) - a novel hyperbolic graph neural network framework to build a session-based recommendation model considering temporal information. More specifically, there are three components in TA-HGAT. First, a hyperbolic projection module transforms the item features into hyperbolic space. Second, the time-aware graph attention module models time intervals between items and the users' current interests. Third, an evolutionary loss at the end of the model provides an accurate prediction of the recommended item based on the given timestamp. TA-HGAT is built in a hyperbolic space to learn the hierarchical structure of session graphs. Experimental results show that the proposed TA-HGAT has the best performance compared to ten baseline models on two real-world datasets.},

  abstract = {The problem of basket recommendation{\textasciitilde}(BR) is to recommend a ranking list of items to the current basket. Existing methods solve this problem by assuming the items within the same basket are correlated by one semantic relation, thus optimizing the item embeddings. However, this assumption breaks when there exist multiple intents within a basket. For example, assuming a basket contains {\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}textit\{bread, cereal, yogurt, soap, detergent\}{\textbackslash}\} where {\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}textit\{bread, cereal, yogurt\}{\textbackslash}\} are correlated through the "breakfast" intent, while {\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}textit\{soap, detergent\}{\textbackslash}\} are of "cleaning" intent, ignoring multiple relations among the items spoils the ability of the model to learn the embeddings. To resolve this issue, it is required to discover the intents within the basket. However, retrieving a multi-intent pattern is rather challenging, as intents are latent within the basket. Additionally, intents within the basket may also be correlated. Moreover, discovering a multi-intent pattern requires modeling high-order interactions, as the intents across different baskets are also correlated. To this end, we propose a new framework named as {\textbackslash}textbf\{M\}ulti-{\textbackslash}textbf\{I\}ntent {\textbackslash}textbf\{T\}ranslation {\textbackslash}textbf\{G\}raph {\textbackslash}textbf\{N\}eural {\textbackslash}textbf\{N\}etwork{\textasciitilde}(\{{\textbackslash}textbf\{MITGNN\}\}). MITGNN models \$T\$ intents as tail entities translated from one corresponding basket embedding via \$T\$ relation vectors. The relation vectors are learned through multi-head aggregators to handle user and item information. Additionally, MITGNN propagates multiple intents across our defined basket graph to learn the embeddings of users and items by aggregating neighbors. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets prove the effectiveness of our proposed model on both transductive and inductive BR.

To address this issue, we introduce an image caption-based method to enhance the model's ability to capture semantic information from images. Formally, we integrate image description information into the text to bridge the semantic gap between text and images. Moreover, to optimize image utilization and enhance the semantic interaction between images and text, we combine global and object features from the images for the final representation. Finally, we leverage a transformer to fuse the above multi-modal content. We carried out extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets, and the results show that our proposed method significantly improves performance compared to other existing methods.},

Our findings challenge the current belief that positive reviews always help enhance box office revenue and shed new light on the influencer-predictor hypothesis.

Although most previous studies focused on the predictive power of "hub" individuals with many social contacts, which sources of customer behavioral data are needed to address this question remains unclear, mostly due to the scarcity of available datasets that simultaneously capture individuals' purchasing patterns and social interactions. Here, we address this question in a unique, large-scale dataset that combines individuals' credit-card purchasing history with their social and mobility traits across an entire nation. Surprisingly, we find that the purchasing history alone enables the detection of small sets of ``discoverers" whose early purchases offer reliable success predictions for the brick-and-mortar stores they visit. In contrast with the assumptions by most existing studies on word-of-mouth processes, the hubs selected by social network centrality are not consistently predictive of success. Our findings show that companies and organizations with access to large-scale purchasing data can detect the discoverers and leverage their behavior to anticipate market trends, without the need for social network data.},

Although recent work has proposed a variety of methods that can directly predict or theoretically bound the generalization capacity of a model, they rely on strong assumptions such as matching train/test distributions and access to model gradients. In order to characterize generalization when these assumptions are not satisfied, we propose neighborhood invariance, a measure of a classifier's output invariance in a local transformation neighborhood. Specifically, we sample a set of transformations and given an input test point, calculate the invariance as the largest fraction of transformed points classified into the same class. Crucially, our measure is simple to calculate, does not depend on the test point's true label, makes no assumptions about the data distribution or model, and can be applied even in out-of-domain (OOD) settings where existing methods cannot, requiring only selecting a set of appropriate data transformations. In experiments on robustness benchmarks in image classification, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference, we demonstrate a strong and robust correlation between our neighborhood invariance measure and actual OOD generalization on over 4,600 models evaluated on over 100 unique train/test domain pairs.},

  abstract = {The discovery of new drugs has important implications for human health. Traditional methods for drug discovery rely on experiments to optimize the structure of lead molecules, which are time-consuming and high-cost. Recently, artificial intelligence has exhibited promising and efficient performance for drug-like molecule generation. In particular, deep generative models achieve great success in de novo generation of drug-like molecules with desired properties, showing massive potential for novel drug discovery. In this study, we review the recent progress of molecule generation using deep generative models, mainly focusing on molecule representations, public databases, data processing tools, and advanced artificial intelligence based molecule generation frameworks. In particular, we present a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art deep generative models for molecule generation and a summary of commonly used molecular design strategies. We identify research gaps and challenges of molecule generation such as the need for better databases, missing 3D information in molecular representation, and the lack of high-precision evaluation metrics. We suggest future directions for molecular generation and drug discovery.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new parameterization of deep neural networks (both fully-connected and convolutional) with guaranteed {$^2$} Lipschitz bounds, i.e. limited sensitivity to input perturbations. The Lipschitz guarantees are equivalent to the tightest-known bounds based on certification via a semidefinite program (SDP). We provide a ``direct'' parameterization, i.e., a smooth mapping from R\textsuperscript{N} onto the set of weights satisfying the SDP-based bound. Moreover, our parameterization is complete, i.e. a neural network satisfies the SDP bound if and only if it can be represented via our parameterization. This enables training using standard gradient methods, without any inner approximation or computationally intensive tasks (e.g. projections or barrier terms) for the SDP constraint. The new parameterization can equivalently be thought of as either a new layer type (the {\textexclamdown}em{\textquestiondown}sandwich layer{\textexclamdown}/em{\textquestiondown}), or a novel parameterization of standard feedforward networks with parameter sharing between neighbouring layers. A comprehensive set of experiments on image classification shows that sandwich layers outperform previous approaches on both empirical and certified robust accuracy.

  abstract = {Methods of transfer learning try to combine knowledge from several related tasks (or domains) to improve performance on a test task. Inspired by causal methodology, we relax the usual covariate shift assumption and assume that it holds true for a subset of predictor variables: the conditional distribution of the target variable given this subset of predictors is invariant over all tasks. We show how this assumption can be motivated from ideas in the field of causality. We focus on the problem of Domain Generalization, in which no examples from the test task are observed. We prove that in an adversarial setting using this subset for prediction is optimal in Domain Generalization; we further provide examples, in which the tasks are sufficiently diverse and the estimator therefore outperforms pooling the data, even on average. If examples from the test task are available, we also provide a method to transfer knowledge from the training tasks and exploit all available features for prediction. However, we provide no guarantees for this method. We introduce a practical method which allows for automatic inference of the above subset and provide corresponding code. We present results on synthetic data sets and a gene deletion data set.},

Due to its wide applicability in the real-world E-commerce industry, the studies NBR have attracted increasing attention in recent years. NBRs have been widely studied and much progress has been achieved in this area with a variety of NBR approaches having been proposed. However, an important issue is that there is a lack of a systematic and unified evaluation over the various NBR approaches. Different studies often evaluate NBR approaches on different datasets, under different experimental settings, making it hard to fairly and effectively compare the performance of different NBR approaches. To bridge this gap, in this work, we conduct a systematical empirical study in NBR area. Specifically, we review the representative work in NBR and analyze their cons and pros. Then, we run the selected NBR algorithms on the same datasets, under the same experimental setting and evaluate their performances using the same measurements. This provides a unified framework to fairly compare different NBR approaches. We hope this study can provide a valuable reference for the future research in this vibrant area.},

However, there has not been a rigorous evaluation regarding the added value of sophisticated compositional functions. In this paper, we conduct a point-by-point comparative study between Simple Word-Embedding-based Models (SWEMs), consisting of parameter-free pooling operations, relative to word-embedding-based RNN/CNN models. Surprisingly, SWEMs exhibit comparable or even superior performance in the majority of cases considered. Based upon this understanding, we propose two additional pooling strategies over learned word embeddings: (i) a max-pooling operation for improved interpretability; and (ii) a hierarchical pooling operation, which preserves spatial (n-gram) information within text sequences. We present experiments on 17 datasets encompassing three tasks: (i) (long) document classification; (ii) text sequence matching; and (iii) short text tasks, including classification and tagging. The source code and datasets can be obtained from https:// github.com/dinghanshen/SWEM.},

This article extends this result in two ways. First, the findings document the existence of ``harbinger zip codes.'' If households in these zip codes adopt a new product, this is a signal that the new product will fail. Second, a series of comparisons reveal that households in harbinger zip codes make other decisions that differ from other households. The first comparison identifies harbinger zip codes using purchases from one retailer and then evaluates purchases at a different retailer. Households in harbinger zip codes purchase products from the second retailer that other households are less likely to purchase. The analysis next compares donations to congressional election candidates; households in harbinger zip codes donate to different candidates than households in neighboring zip codes, and they donate to candidates who are less likely to win. House prices in harbinger zip codes also increase at slower rates than in neighboring zip codes. Investigation of households that change zip codes indicates that the harbinger zip code effect is more due to where customers choose to live, rather than households influencing their neighbors' tendencies.},

  abstract = {A plethora of AI-based techniques now exists to conduct de novo molecule generation that can devise molecules conditioned towards a particular endpoint in the context of drug design. One popular approach is using reinforcement learning to update a recurrent neural network or language-based de novo molecule generator. However, reinforcement learning can be inefficient, sometimes requiring up to 105 molecules to be sampled to optimize more complex objectives, which poses a limitation when using computationally expensive scoring functions like docking or computer-aided synthesis planning models. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning strategy called Augmented Hill-Climb based on a simple, hypothesis-driven hybrid between REINVENT and Hill-Climb that improves sample-efficiency by addressing the limitations of both currently used strategies. We compare its ability to optimize several docking tasks with REINVENT and benchmark this strategy against other commonly used reinforcement learning strategies including REINFORCE, REINVENT (version 1 and 2), Hill-Climb and best agent reminder. We find that optimization ability is improved\,{\textasciitilde}\,1.5-fold and sample-efficiency is improved\,{\textasciitilde}\,45-fold compared to REINVENT while still delivering appealing chemistry as output. Diversity filters were used, and their parameters were tuned to overcome observed failure modes that take advantage of certain diversity filter configurations. We find that Augmented Hill-Climb outperforms the other reinforcement learning strategies used on six tasks, especially in the early stages of training or for more difficult objectives. Lastly, we show improved performance not only on recurrent neural networks but also on a reinforcement learning stabilized transformer architecture. Overall, we show that Augmented~Hill-Climb improves sample-efficiency for language-based de novo molecule generation conditioning via reinforcement learning, compared to the current state-of-the-art. This makes more computationally expensive scoring functions, such as docking, more accessible on a relevant timescale.},

Narratives are often described as moving quickly, covering lots of ground, or going in circles, but little work has quantified such movements or tested whether they might explain success. We use natural language processing and machine learning to analyze the content of almost 50,000 texts, constructing a simple set of measures (i.e., speed, volume, and circuitousness) that quantify the semantic progression of discourse. While movies and TV shows that move faster are liked more, TV shows that cover more ground are liked less. Academic papers that move faster are cited less, and papers that cover more ground or are more circuitous are cited more.           ,              Narratives, and other forms of discourse, are powerful vehicles for informing, entertaining, and making sense of the world. But while everyday language often describes discourse as moving quickly or slowly, covering a lot of ground, or going in circles, little work has actually quantified such movements or examined whether they are beneficial. To fill this gap, we use several state-of-the-art natural language-processing and machine-learning techniques to represent texts as sequences of points in a latent, high-dimensional semantic space. We construct a simple set of measures to quantify features of this semantic path, apply them to thousands of texts from a variety of domains (i.e., movies, TV shows, and academic papers), and examine whether and how they are linked to success (e.g., the number of citations a paper receives). Our results highlight some important cross-domain differences and provide a general framework that can be applied to study many types of discourse. The findings shed light on why things become popular and how natural language processing can provide insight into cultural success.},

  abstract = {Complementary products recommendation is an important problem in e-commerce. Such recommendations increase the average order price and the number of products in baskets. Complementary products are typically inferred from basket data. In this study, we propose the BB2vec model. The BB2vec model learns vector representations of products by analyzing jointly two types of data - Baskets and Browsing sessions (visiting web pages of products). These vector representations are used for making complementary products recommendation. The proposed model alleviates the cold start problem by delivering better recommendations for products having few or no purchases. We show that the BB2vec model has better performance than other models which use only basket data.},

  abstract = {Digital Mass Media has become the new paradigm of communication that revolves around online social networks. The increase in the utilization of online social networks (OSNs) as the primary source of information and the increase of online social platforms providing such news has increased the scope of spreading fake news. People spread fake news in multimedia formats like images, audio, and video. Visual-based news is prone to have a psychological impact on the users and is often misleading. Therefore, Multimodal frameworks for detecting fake posts have gained demand in recent times. This paper proposes a framework that flags fake posts with Visual data embedded with text. The proposed framework works on data derived from the Fakeddit dataset, with over 1 million samples containing text, image, metadata, and comments data gathered from a wide range of sources, and tries to exploit the unique features of fake and legitimate images. The proposed framework has different architectures to learn visual and linguistic models from the post individually. Image polarity datasets, derived from Flickr, are also considered for analysis, and the features extracted from these visual and text-based data helped in flagging news. The proposed fusion model has achieved an overall accuracy of 91.94\%, Precision of 93.43\%, Recall of 93.07\%, and F1-score of 93\%. The experimental results show that the proposed Multimodality model with Image and Text achieves better results than other state-of-art models working on a similar dataset.},

However, no systematic analysis of the breeding (i.e., innovation) and branding (i.e., marketing) returns from such investments exists. In this study, the authors conceptualize and empirically estimate the breeding and branding returns that such manufacturers obtain. The authors gather data for 30 car brands of 16 manufacturers over the period 2000--2015 regarding their participation, spending, and performance in Formula One championships, annual patent citations, and research-and-development (R\&D) budgets as well as monthly vehicle registrations, advertising expenditures, and Formula One TV viewership. The authors find that only gear manufacturers with relatively high levels of R\&D spending obtain a positive and significant breeding return from competing in sports contests. While most brands obtain positive branding returns, the lower the level of advertising spending for the brand, the greater the branding returns they obtain from competing in these contests. Thus, research-intense (compared with advertising-intense) gear manufacturers have more to gain from competing in sports contests. These findings can help guide manufacturers in budget allocation decisions on sports competitions, R\&D, and advertising.},

The goal of next-basket prediction is to predict a coherent set of products that the customer will buy next, rather than just a single product. However, if the assortment of the retailer contains thousands of products, the number of possible baskets becomes extremely large and most standard choice models can no longer be applied. Therefore, we propose the use of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network for next-basket prediction in this study, which is easily scalable to large assortments. Our proposed model is able to capture dynamic customer taste, recurrency in purchase behavior and frequent product co-occurrences in shopping baskets. Moreover, it allows for the inclusion of additional covariates. Using two real-life datasets, we demonstrate that our model is able to outperform both naive benchmarks and a state-of-the-art next-basket prediction model on several performance measures. We also illustrate that the model learns meaningful patterns about the retailer's assortment structure.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Vector autoregressive models (VAR) are popular approaches for topology inference of directed graphs; however, in large networks with short time-series, topology estimation becomes ill-posed. The present paper proposes a novel nonlinearity-preserving topology inference method for directed networks with co-evolving nodal processes that solves the ill-posedness problem. The proposed method, large-scale kernelized Granger causality (lsKGC), uses kernel functions to transform data into a low-dimensional feature space and solves the autoregressive problem in the feature space, then finds the pre-images in the input space to infer the topology. Extensive simulations on synthetic datasets with nonlinear and linear dependencies and known ground-truth demonstrate significant improvement in the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve ( AUC ) of the receiver operating characteristic for network recovery compared to existing methods. Furthermore, tests on real datasets from a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study demonstrate 96.3 percent accuracy in diagnosis tasks of schizophrenia patients, which is the highest in the literature with only brain time-series information.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the optimal design of a paywall when consumers endogenously determine their amount of content consumption.           ,              Digital content platforms increasingly implement paywalls to generate subscription revenue, but putting content behind paywalls can reduce consumption and advertising revenue. We analyze optimal paywall design when consumers are heterogenous in their valuation for and satiation with content and endogenously determine their consumption. We find that, under moderate ad rates, a metered paywall offering a limited amount of free content is optimal when consumers display sufficient heterogeneity in satiation. When ad rates increase, one might expect platforms to offer more free content to generate higher ad revenue. Instead, we find that sometimes offering less free content and lowering the subscription price is optimal to attract new subscribers. Further, depending on ad rates, the optimal amount of free content may increase or decrease in consumers' valuation for content. As valuation increases, consumers' willingness to pay for subscription and desire for content consumption increases. The former effect dominates under low ad rates and incentivizes the platform to provide less free content, but the opposite is true under high ad rates. Counterintuitively, we also find that total content consumption can increase with the proportion of users who become satiated relatively faster because the platform may strategically raise its meter limit to increase ad revenues from nonsubscribers. We also explore the impact of a more appealing outside option for consumers, competition between media platforms, and correlation between valuation and satiation on the optimality of paywalls.

In this work, we present a new state-of-the-art unsupervised method based on pre-trained Transformers and Sequential Denoising Auto-Encoder (TSDAE) which outperforms previous approaches by up to 6.4 points. It can achieve up to 93.1\% of the performance of in-domain supervised approaches. Further, we show that TSDAE is a strong domain adaptation and pre-training method for sentence embeddings, significantly outperforming other approaches like Masked Language Model. A crucial shortcoming of previous studies is the narrow evaluation: Most work mainly evaluates on the single task of Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), which does not require any domain knowledge. It is unclear if these proposed methods generalize to other domains and tasks. We fill this gap and evaluate TSDAE and other recent approaches on four different datasets from heterogeneous domains.},

In this paper, a new approach to enhance NN training with physical knowledge using constraint optimization techniques is presented. Specific constraints for hyperelastic materials are introduced, which include energy conservation, normalization and material symmetries. We show, that the introduced enhancements lead to better learning behavior with respect to well known issues like a small number of training samples or noisy data. The NN is used as a material law within a finite element analysis and its convergence behavior is discussed with regard to the newly introduced training enhancements. The feasibility of NNs trained with physical constraints is shown for data based on real world experiments. We show, that the enhanced training outperforms state-of-the-art techniques with respect to stability and convergence behavior within FE simulations.},

This paper describes a catalog of prompt engineering techniques presented in pattern form that have been applied to solve common problems when conversing with LLMs. Prompt patterns are a knowledge transfer method analogous to software patterns since they provide reusable solutions to common problems faced in a particular context, i.e., output generation and interaction when working with LLMs. This paper provides the following contributions to research on prompt engineering that apply LLMs to automate software development tasks. First, it provides a framework for documenting patterns for structuring prompts to solve a range of problems so that they can be adapted to different domains. Second, it presents a catalog of patterns that have been applied successfully to improve the outputs of LLM conversations. Third, it explains how prompts can be built from multiple patterns and illustrates prompt patterns that benefit from combination with other prompt patterns.},

In what condition will one bundling strategy dominate the others? How does the degree of complementarity affect the firms' decision?                                         Design/methodology/approach               Using the game theory, this study first establishes three models of bundling strategies: no bundling, pure bundling and mixed bundling and then obtains the optimal prices and quality decisions. This study uses numerical analysis to explore the relationships between the prices (demands and profits) and some key parameters and to obtain some valuable management complications.                                         Findings               Some interesting and valuable management implications are established: regardless of the degree of complementarity, adopting a pure bundling or mixed bundling strategy is better than separately selling an individual product; a high degree of complementarity leads to reduced profit in the no bundling and mixed bundling scenarios, whereas the condition in the pure bundling strategy is the opposite; and when the degree of complementarity is adequately large, choosing pure bundling strategy is more profitable.                                         Research limitations/implications               On the one hand, this study does not calculate the profit sharing ratio, and hence, the equilibrium profit sharing ratio can be explored in future work. On the other hand, marketing efforts (e.g. advertising and promotion) can be included in the study.                                         Practical implications               This study derives the necessary conditions for the most effective bundling strategy that maximizes firm's profits, and these conclusions can provide a decision reference to the bundling decisions of firms.                                         Originality/value               First, the optimal bundling strategies in a horizontal supply chain consisting of two firms is considered. Under the pure and mixed bundling strategies, the two firms sell the bundled product by building a cooperative program. Second, both the pricing policies and quality decisions of supply chain members under the different bundling strategies are studied.},

Using data on the free-agency contracts signed in the NBA during the four-year period from 1994 to 1997, we find that both older players and players with higher performance are more likely to match with teams with more wins. However, controlling for performance, we find that brand alliances between high brand equity players (defined as receiving enough votes to be an all-star starter) and medium brand equity teams (defined by stadium and broadcast revenues) generate the highest value. This suggests that top brands are not necessarily best off matching with other top brands. We also provide suggestive evidence that the maximum salary policy implemented in 1998 influenced matches based on brand equity spillovers more than matches based on performance complementarities.},

  abstract = {Building predictive models for companies often relies on inference using historical data of companies in the same industry sector. However, companies are similar across a variety of dimensions that should be leveraged in relevant prediction problems. This is particularly true for large, complex organizations which may not be well defined by a single industry and have no clear peers. To enable prediction using company information across a variety of dimensions, we create an embedding of company stocks, Stock2Vec, which can be easily added to any prediction model that applies to companies with associated stock prices. We describe the process of creating this rich vector representation from stock price fluctuations, and characterize what the dimensions represent. We then conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate this embedding in applied machine learning problems in various business contexts. Our experiment results demonstrate that the four features in the Stock2Vec embedding can readily augment existing cross-company models and enhance cross-company predictions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel study on harnessing Large Language Models' (LLMs) outstanding knowledge and reasoning abilities for explainable financial time series forecasting. The application of machine learning models to financial time series comes with several challenges, including the difficulty in cross-sequence reasoning and inference, the hurdle of incorporating multi-modal signals from historical news, financial knowledge graphs, etc., and the issue of interpreting and explaining the model results. In this paper, we focus on NASDAQ-100 stocks, making use of publicly accessible historical stock price data, company metadata, and historical economic/financial news. We conduct experiments to illustrate the potential of LLMs in offering a unified solution to the aforementioned challenges. Our experiments include trying zero-shot/few-shot inference with GPT-4 and instruction-based fine-tuning with a public LLM model Open LLaMA. We demonstrate our approach outperforms a few baselines, including the widely applied classic ARMA-GARCH model and a gradient-boosting tree model. Through the performance comparison results and a few examples, we find LLMs can make a well-thought decision by reasoning over information from both textual news and price time series and extracting insights, leveraging cross-sequence information, and utilizing the inherent knowledge embedded within the LLM. Additionally, we show that a publicly available LLM such as Open-LLaMA, after fine-tuning, can comprehend the instruction to generate explainable forecasts and achieve reasonable performance, albeit relatively inferior in comparison to GPT-4.},
